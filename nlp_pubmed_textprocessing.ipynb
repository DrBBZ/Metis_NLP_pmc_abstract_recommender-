       "' Although current research has contributed to the promotion of whole-food plant-based diets, few studies have examined healthy vegan dietary and lifestyle factors, especially in South America. Therefore, we aimed at investigating the adherence to healthy vegan lifestyle habits among Argentinian vegetarians and omnivorous, using a recently developed vegetarian lifestyle index adapted to the vegan dietary pattern. Also, accessibility of vegetarian foods, and the proportion of household income spent on food were assessed in a cross-sectional approach with 1454 participants. The population was comprised of females (84.9%), singles (55.0%), young-adults (mean age 32.1, standard deviation (SD) = 13.6), employed (50.8%), with high educational levels (50.4%), and low prevalence of both tobacco smoking (7.0%) and frequent alcohol consumption (7.6%). The mean score of adherence to healthy vegan lifestyle habits was 6.64 (SD = 1.72), with higher scores indicating better adherence. Non-vegetarians (5.75; 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.61–5.89) had a significantly lower adjusted mean score compared to semi-(6.32; 95% CI, 6.17–6.47), pesco-(6.99; 95% CI, 6.59–7.39), lacto-ovo-vegetarians (7.10; 95% CI, 6.96–7.24), as well as vegans (8.59; 95% CI, 8.35–8.83). The mean proportion of household income spent on food was significantly lower among vegans compared with other dietary patterns. The whole population that was studied showed a low consumption of whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Although vegans showed a better diet and lifestyle pattern there is a need to improve eating and lifestyle habits to address risk factors for non-communicable diseases in Argentina.'"

       "' Plant-based diets, defined here as including both vegan and lacto-ovo-vegetarian diets, are growing in popularity throughout the Western world for various reasons, including concerns for human health and the health of the planet. Plant-based diets are more environmentally sustainable than meat-based diets and have a reduced environmental impact, including producing lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions. Dietary guidelines are normally formulated to enhance the health of society, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and prevent nutritional deficiencies. We reviewed the scientific data on plant-based diets to summarize their preventative and therapeutic role in cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, and osteoporosis. Consuming plant-based diets is safe and effective for all stages of the life cycle, from pregnancy and lactation, to childhood, to old age. Plant-based diets, which are high in fiber and polyphenolics, are also associated with a diverse gut microbiota, producing metabolites that have anti-inflammatory functions that may help manage disease processes. Concerns about the adequate intake of a number of nutrients, including vitamin B12, calcium, vitamin D, iron, zinc, and omega-3 fats, are discussed. The use of fortified foods and/or supplements as well as appropriate food choices are outlined for each nutrient. Finally, guidelines are suggested for health professionals working with clients consuming plant-based diets.'"

       "' Health authorities increasingly recommend a more plant-based diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, pulses, whole grains and nuts, low in red meat and moderate in dairy, eggs, poultry and fish which will be beneficial for both health and the environment. A systematic review of observational and intervention studies published between 2000 and January 2020 was conducted to assess nutrient intake and status in adult populations consuming plant-based diets (mainly vegetarian and vegan) with that of meat-eaters. Mean intake of nutrients were calculated and benchmarked to dietary reference values. For micronutrient status, mean concentrations of biomarkers were calculated and compared across diet groups. A total of 141 studies were included, mostly from Europe, South/East Asia, and North America. Protein intake was lower in people following plant-based diets compared to meat-eaters, but well within recommended intake levels. While fiber, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), folate, vitamin C, E and magnesium intake was higher, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) intake was lower in vegetarians and vegans as compared to meat-eaters. Intake and status of vitamin B12, vitamin D, iron, zinc, iodine, calcium and bone turnover markers were generally lower in plant-based dietary patterns compared to meat-eaters. Vegans had the lowest vitamin B12, calcium and iodine intake, and also lower iodine status and lower bone mineral density. Meat-eaters were at risk of inadequate intakes of fiber, PUFA, α-linolenic acid (ALA), folate, vitamin D, E, calcium and magnesium. There were nutrient inadequacies across all dietary patterns, including vegan, vegetarian and meat-based diets. As plant-based diets are generally better for health and the environment, public health strategies should facilitate the transition to a balanced diet with more diverse nutrient-dense plant foods through consumer education, food fortification and possibly supplementation.'"

       "      <td>Simple Summary: Many plant-based feedstuffs contain non-digestible factors, such as β-mannans, that may reduce growth performance, as well as energy and nutrient digestibility. However, weaning pigs lack enzymes—such as β-mannanase—necessary to more completely digest β-mannan. Therefore, this experiment aimed to investigate the effects of dietary β-mannanase supplementation on growth performance, apparent total tract digestibility of nutrients, intestinal integrity and the immunological and oxidative stress parameters of weaning pigs. Our result suggested that adding β-mannanase to the weaning pigs’ diet increased the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of ether extract, jejunum villus height, and villus height-to-crypt depth ratio, and lowered crypt depth compared with those fed the no-β-mannanase diet. This study indicated that the inclusion of β-mannanase showed the potential to improve fat digestibility, intestinal development and gut health of weaning pigs. Abstract: The experiment aimed to investigate the effects of dietary β-mannanase supplementation on growth performance, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients, intestinal integrity, and the immunological and oxidative stress parameters in weaning pigs. A total of 64 newly weaning pigs (initial body weight: 6.96 ± 0.70 kg) were allotted to two dietary treatments in eight replicates per treatment with four pigs per pen based on body weight and sex. Dietary treatments were 1.) CON (control: corn-soybean meal based basal diet) and 2.) β-mannanase (basal diet +0.06% β-mannanase). The β-mannanase supplementation did not affect growth performance, concentrations of acute phase protein, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. However, the pigs fed the β-mannanase-supplemented diet had greater ATTD of ether extract, jejunum villus height, and villus height-to-crypt depth ratio, and lower crypt depth compared with those fed the CON diet (p &lt; 0.05). The pigs fed the β-mannanase-supplemented diet tended to have the lower count of E. coli in cecum than those fed the CON diet (p = 0.08). In conclusion, dietary β-mannanase supplementation did not affect growth performance, immune response and oxidative stress of weaning pigs, whereas it increased fat digestibility and had positive effects on intestinal integrity and cecum microflora by reducing the count of E.coli.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The study aim was to investigate differences in nutritional, cardiovascular and lifestyle status of ‘health conscious’ subjects. In a partial ‘lock-down’ during the COVID-19 pandemic period, we performed a web-based, cross-sectional study. We compared 80 self-selected subjects (51 vegans, 67% females, and 29 non-vegans, 55% females, p = 0.344). Nutritional status was assessed by bio-electrical impedance and standardized food frequency questionnaires (i.e., contribution of nutrients from foods and supplementation, combined and separate). Serum lipid concentrations and blood pressure (BP) were assessed from annual or initial examination reports, while sociodemographic, economic, and lifestyle statuses were obtained by standardized questionnaires. Finally, a multivariate linear regression model was used to estimate the relationship between total fiber and saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) values. The vegans had a significantly lower body mass index (22.8 ± 2.4 vs. 26.6 ± 3.6 kg/m2, p &lt; 0.001) and body fat % (19.3 ± 7.3 vs. 25.8 ± 8.2%, p &lt; 0.001) than the non-vegans. There were significant differences between vegans and non-vegans in energy intake, and most macronutrient (10/12) and micronutrient (15/23) intakes in units/day. Both diets were well designed, with high fiber and low SFA and free sugar intake but remained insufficient in n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (for vegans), vitamin D, calcium, sodium (for vegans) and iodine. Vegans also had a significantly lower lipid profile and BP than non-vegans, except for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, both groups met targeted recommendations. Furthermore, fiber and SFA intake and age explained 47% of the variance in LDL cholesterol. In conclusion, ‘health conscious’ vegans and non-vegans with comparable lifestyle statuses had significant differences in dietary intake, body composition and cardiovascular health status.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Background: Adoption of healthy and sustainable diets could be essential for safe-guarding the Earth's natural resources and reducing diet-related mortality, but their adoption could be hampered if such diets proved to be more expensive and unaffordable for some populations. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the costs of healthy and sustainable diets around the world. Methods: In this modelling study, we used regionally comparable food prices from the International Comparison Program for 150 countries. We paired those prices with estimates of food demand for different dietary patterns that, in modelling studies, have been associated with reductions in premature mortality and environmental resource demand, including nutritionally balanced flexitarian, pescatarian, vegetarian, and vegan diets. We used estimates of food waste and projections of food demand and prices to specify food system and socioeconomic change scenarios up to 2050. In the full cost accounting, we estimated diet-related health-care costs by pairing a comparative risk assessment of dietary risks with cost-of-illness estimates, and we estimated climate change costs by pairing the diet scenarios with greenhouse gas emission footprints and estimates of the social cost of carbon. Findings: Compared with the cost of current diets, the healthy and sustainable dietary patterns were, depending on the pattern, up to 22–34% lower in cost in upper-middle-income to high-income countries on average (when considering statistical means), but at least 18–29% more expensive in lower-middle-income to low-income countries. Reductions in food waste, a favourable socioeconomic development scenario, and a fuller cost accounting that included the diet-related costs of climate change and health care in the cost of diets increased the affordability of the dietary patterns in our future projections. When these measures were combined, the healthy and sustainable dietary patterns were up to 25–29% lower in cost in low-income to lower-middle-income countries, and up to 37% lower in cost on average, for the year 2050. Variants of vegetarian and vegan dietary patterns were generally most affordable, and pescatarian diets were least affordable. Interpretation: In high-income and upper-middle-income countries, dietary change interventions that incentivise adoption of healthy and sustainable diets can help consumers in those countries reduce costs while, at the same time, contribute to fulfilling national climate change commitments and reduce public health spending. In low-income and lower-middle-income countries, healthy and sustainable diets are substantially less costly than western diets and can also be cost-competitive in the medium-to-long term, subject to beneficial socioeconomic development and reductions in food waste. A fuller accounting of the costs of diets would make healthy and sustainable diets the least costly option in most countries in the future.

       "      <td>Vegetarian (VG) and vegan (VN) diets in childhood are of growing interest due to their perceived health and environmental benefits. Concerns remain due to the possible disruption of healthy growth and development of children because of the scarcity of evidence-based studies. Among the nutrients of special concern is vitamin B12. Therefore, the Czech Vegan Children Study (CAROTS) decided to examine the relationship between B12 metabolism parameters and B12 intake through diet and supplementation. We analyzed laboratory parameters within n = 79 VG, n = 69 VN, and n = 52 omnivores (OM) children (0–18 years old). There were no significant differences in levels of holotranscobalamin (aB12), folate, homocysteine (hcys), or mean corpuscular volume. However, there was a significant difference in levels of cyanocobalamin (B12) (p = 0.018), even though we identified only n = 1 VG and n = 2 VN children as B12 deficient. On the other hand, we identified n = 35 VG, n = 28 VN, and n = 9 OM children with vitamin B12 hypervitaminosis (p = 0.004). This finding was related to a high prevalence of over-supplementation in the group (mean dose for VG 178.19 ± 238.5 µg per day; VN 278.35 ± 394.63 µg per day). Additionally, we found a significant (p &lt; 0.05) difference between B12, aB12, and hcys levels of supplemented vs. non-supplemented VG/VN children. This can show that the intake of vitamin B12 via diet in the VG group might not be sufficient. Secondly, we analyzed a relation between supplement use in pregnancy and breastfeeding and its impact on vitamin B12 levels of children aged 0–3 years. Out of n = 46 mothers, only n = 3 (e.g., 6.5%) were not supplemented at all. We have not identified any clinical manifestation of B12 deficiency and only n = 1 child with low serum cobalamin, a child who did not receive vitamin B12 supplementation and whose mother took only low doses of vitamin B12 (25/µg/day).To conclude, we did not observe any life-threatening or severe consequences of laboratory-stated vitamin B12 deficiency; thus, our group was well supplemented. On the other hand, we have identified many subjects with vitamin B12 hypervitaminosis of unknown impact on their health. Further research and new guidelines for B12 supplementation among VG and VN children are needed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Brain aging is a complex and multifactorial process broadly involving changes in the brain’s structure, neuronal activity, and biochemical profile. These changes in brain function have also been linked to age-associated variations in cognitive function. Recent research has suggested a role of increased oxidative stress and reduced cognition in older people. Therefore, studies that examine the effects of antioxidants on cognitive performance are important, particularly in the context of an increase in elderly populations in most Western countries. One such antioxidant, Pycnogenol, is a standardized plant-based extract obtained from the bark of the French maritime pine and has a long historical use to treat inflammation and improve health. More recently, Pycnogenol has been subjected to more than 100 research trials. In vitro and animal studies using the standardized extract have indicated a multimodal action of Pycnogenol, and several human studies have shown improvements in cognitive function after chronic administration. In this paper, we review these studies in the context of understanding both biological and cognitive changes due to Pycnogenol and evaluate possibilities of Pycnogenol to improve neurocognitive function.</td>\n",

However, weaning pigs lack enzymes—such as β-mannanase—necessary to more completely digest β-mannan. Therefore, this experiment aimed to investigate the effects of dietary β-mannanase supplementation on growth performance, apparent total tract digestibility of nutrients, intestinal integrity and the immunological and oxidative stress parameters of weaning pigs. Our result suggested that adding β-mannanase to the weaning pigs’ diet increased the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of ether extract, jejunum villus height, and villus height-to-crypt depth ratio, and lowered crypt depth compared with those fed the no-β-mannanase diet. This study indicated that the inclusion of β-mannanase showed the potential to improve fat digestibility, intestinal development and gut health of weaning pigs. Abstract: The experiment aimed to investigate the effects of dietary β-mannanase supplementation on growth performance, apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients, intestinal integrity, and the immunological and oxidative stress parameters in weaning pigs. A total of 64 newly weaning pigs (initial body weight: 6.96 ± 0.70 kg) were allotted to two dietary treatments in eight replicates per treatment with four pigs per pen based on body weight and sex. Dietary treatments were 1.) CON (control: corn-soybean meal based basal diet) and 2.) β-mannanase (basal diet +0.06% β-mannanase). The β-mannanase supplementation did not affect growth performance, concentrations of acute phase protein, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. However, the pigs fed the β-mannanase-supplemented diet had greater ATTD of ether extract, jejunum villus height, and villus height-to-crypt depth ratio, and lower crypt depth compared with those fed the CON diet (p < 0.05). The pigs fed the β-mannanase-supplemented diet tended to have the lower count of E. coli in cecum than those fed the CON diet (p = 0.08). In conclusion, dietary β-mannanase supplementation did not affect growth performance, immune response and oxidative stress of weaning pigs, whereas it increased fat digestibility and had positive effects on intestinal integrity and cecum microflora by reducing the count of E.coli.   \n",

In a partial ‘lock-down’ during the COVID-19 pandemic period, we performed a web-based, cross-sectional study. We compared 80 self-selected subjects (51 vegans, 67% females, and 29 non-vegans, 55% females, p = 0.344). Nutritional status was assessed by bio-electrical impedance and standardized food frequency questionnaires (i.e., contribution of nutrients from foods and supplementation, combined and separate). Serum lipid concentrations and blood pressure (BP) were assessed from annual or initial examination reports, while sociodemographic, economic, and lifestyle statuses were obtained by standardized questionnaires. Finally, a multivariate linear regression model was used to estimate the relationship between total fiber and saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) values. The vegans had a significantly lower body mass index (22.8 ± 2.4 vs. 26.6 ± 3.6 kg/m2, p < 0.001) and body fat % (19.3 ± 7.3 vs. 25.8 ± 8.2%, p < 0.001) than the non-vegans. There were significant differences between vegans and non-vegans in energy intake, and most macronutrient (10/12) and micronutrient (15/23) intakes in units/day. Both diets were well designed, with high fiber and low SFA and free sugar intake but remained insufficient in n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (for vegans), vitamin D, calcium, sodium (for vegans) and iodine. Vegans also had a significantly lower lipid profile and BP than non-vegans, except for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, both groups met targeted recommendations. Furthermore, fiber and SFA intake and age explained 47% of the variance in LDL cholesterol. In conclusion, ‘health conscious’ vegans and non-vegans with comparable lifestyle statuses had significant differences in dietary intake, body composition and cardiovascular health status.   \n",
       "966     Background: Adoption of healthy and sustainable diets could be essential for safe-guarding the Earth's natural resources and reducing diet-related mortality, but their adoption could be hampered if such diets proved to be more expensive and unaffordable for some populations. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the costs of healthy and sustainable diets around the world. Methods: In this modelling study, we used regionally comparable food prices from the International Comparison Program for 150 countries. We paired those prices with estimates of food demand for different dietary patterns that, in modelling studies, have been associated with reductions in premature mortality and environmental resource demand, including nutritionally balanced flexitarian, pescatarian, vegetarian, and vegan diets. We used estimates of food waste and projections of food demand and prices to specify food system and socioeconomic change scenarios up to 2050. In the full cost accounting, we estimated diet-related health-care costs by pairing a comparative risk assessment of dietary risks with cost-of-illness estimates, and we estimated climate change costs by pairing the diet scenarios with greenhouse gas emission footprints and estimates of the social cost of carbon. Findings: Compared with the cost of current diets, the healthy and sustainable dietary patterns were, depending on the pattern, up to 22–34% lower in cost in upper-middle-income to high-income countries on average (when considering statistical means), but at least 18–29% more expensive in lower-middle-income to low-income countries. Reductions in food waste, a favourable socioeconomic development scenario, and a fuller cost accounting that included the diet-related costs of climate change and health care in the cost of diets increased the affordability of the dietary patterns in our future projections. When these measures were combined, the healthy and sustainable dietary patterns were up to 25–29% lower in cost in low-income to lower-middle-income countries, and up to 37% lower in cost on average, for the year 2050. Variants of vegetarian and vegan dietary patterns were generally most affordable, and pescatarian diets were least affordable. Interpretation: In high-income and upper-middle-income countries, dietary change interventions that incentivise adoption of healthy and sustainable diets can help consumers in those countries reduce costs while, at the same time, contribute to fulfilling national climate change commitments and reduce public health spending. In low-income and lower-middle-income countries, healthy and sustainable diets are substantially less costly than western diets and can also be cost-competitive in the medium-to-long term, subject to beneficial socioeconomic development and reductions in food waste. A fuller accounting of the costs of diets would make healthy and sustainable diets the least costly option in most countries in the future.

Concerns remain due to the possible disruption of healthy growth and development of children because of the scarcity of evidence-based studies. Among the nutrients of special concern is vitamin B12. Therefore, the Czech Vegan Children Study (CAROTS) decided to examine the relationship between B12 metabolism parameters and B12 intake through diet and supplementation. We analyzed laboratory parameters within n = 79 VG, n = 69 VN, and n = 52 omnivores (OM) children (0–18 years old). There were no significant differences in levels of holotranscobalamin (aB12), folate, homocysteine (hcys), or mean corpuscular volume. However, there was a significant difference in levels of cyanocobalamin (B12) (p = 0.018), even though we identified only n = 1 VG and n = 2 VN children as B12 deficient. On the other hand, we identified n = 35 VG, n = 28 VN, and n = 9 OM children with vitamin B12 hypervitaminosis (p = 0.004). This finding was related to a high prevalence of over-supplementation in the group (mean dose for VG 178.19 ± 238.5 µg per day; VN 278.35 ± 394.63 µg per day). Additionally, we found a significant (p < 0.05) difference between B12, aB12, and hcys levels of supplemented vs. non-supplemented VG/VN children. This can show that the intake of vitamin B12 via diet in the VG group might not be sufficient. Secondly, we analyzed a relation between supplement use in pregnancy and breastfeeding and its impact on vitamin B12 levels of children aged 0–3 years. Out of n = 46 mothers, only n = 3 (e.g., 6.5%) were not supplemented at all. We have not identified any clinical manifestation of B12 deficiency and only n = 1 child with low serum cobalamin, a child who did not receive vitamin B12 supplementation and whose mother took only low doses of vitamin B12 (25/µg/day).To conclude, we did not observe any life-threatening or severe consequences of laboratory-stated vitamin B12 deficiency; thus, our group was well supplemented. On the other hand, we have identified many subjects with vitamin B12 hypervitaminosis of unknown impact on their health. Further research and new guidelines for B12 supplementation among VG and VN children are needed.   \n",

These changes in brain function have also been linked to age-associated variations in cognitive function. Recent research has suggested a role of increased oxidative stress and reduced cognition in older people. Therefore, studies that examine the effects of antioxidants on cognitive performance are important, particularly in the context of an increase in elderly populations in most Western countries. One such antioxidant, Pycnogenol, is a standardized plant-based extract obtained from the bark of the French maritime pine and has a long historical use to treat inflammation and improve health. More recently, Pycnogenol has been subjected to more than 100 research trials. In vitro and animal studies using the standardized extract have indicated a multimodal action of Pycnogenol, and several human studies have shown improvements in cognitive function after chronic administration. In this paper, we review these studies in the context of understanding both biological and cognitive changes due to Pycnogenol and evaluate possibilities of Pycnogenol to improve neurocognitive function.   \n",

       "966     background  adoption of healthy and sustainable diets could be essential for safe guarding the earth s natural resources and reducing diet related mortality  but their adoption could be hampered if such diets proved to be more expensive and unaffordable for some populations  therefore  we aimed to estimate the costs of healthy and sustainable diets around the world  methods  in this modelling study  we used regionally comparable food prices from the international comparison program for   countries  we paired those prices with estimates of food demand for different dietary patterns that  in modelling studies  have been associated with reductions in premature mortality and environmental resource demand  including nutritionally balanced flexitarian  pescatarian  vegetarian  and vegan diets  we used estimates of food waste and projections of food demand and prices to specify food system and socioeconomic change scenarios up to    in the full cost accounting  we estimated diet related health care costs by pairing a comparative risk assessment of dietary risks with cost of illness estimates  and we estimated climate change costs by pairing the diet scenarios with greenhouse gas emission footprints and estimates of the social cost of carbon  findings  compared with the cost of current diets  the healthy and sustainable dietary patterns were  depending on the pattern  up to    lower in cost in upper middle income to high income countries on average  when considering statistical means   but at least    more expensive in lower middle income to low income countries  reductions in food waste  a favourable socioeconomic development scenario  and a fuller cost accounting that included the diet related costs of climate change and health care in the cost of diets increased the affordability of the dietary patterns in our future projections  when these measures were combined  the healthy and sustainable dietary patterns were up to    lower in cost in low income to lower middle income countries  and up to    lower in cost on average  for the year    variants of vegetarian and vegan dietary patterns were generally most affordable  and pescatarian diets were least affordable  interpretation  in high income and upper middle income countries  dietary change interventions that incentivise adoption of healthy and sustainable diets can help consumers in those countries reduce costs while  at the same time  contribute to fulfilling national climate change commitments and reduce public health spending  in low income and lower middle income countries  healthy and sustainable diets are substantially less costly than western diets and can also be cost competitive in the medium to long term  subject to beneficial socioeconomic development and reductions in food waste  a fuller accounting of the costs of diets would make healthy and sustainable diets the least costly option in most countries in the future  funding  global panel on agriculture and food systems for nutrition and wellcome trust   \n",

       "      <td>Introduction: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) causes severe disturbances in phosphate metabolism. New Nordic Renal Diet (NNRD) is a new dietary concept designed by the present research group that aims to offer patients with moderate CKD a whole food approach with a markedly reduction in dietary phosphorus intake, corresponding to 850 mg/day. The present protocol describes a randomised controlled trial aiming to test the long-term effects of dietary intervention with NNRD versus a non-restricted habitual diet on important parameters of phosphorus and lipid homeostasis. Methods and analysis: This trial will be executed at the Department of Nephrology, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Denmark. Sixty patients aged &gt;18 years with CKD stages 3 and 4 (estimated glomerular filtration rate between 15 and 45 mL/min) will be recruited and randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. The other inclusion criterion includes a medically stable condition for at least 2 months prior to the start of the study. Exclusion criteria are treatment with phosphate binders, metabolic disorders that require specific dietary regulation, pregnancy and breast feeding, any types of food allergies or those who are vegans. The observation period is 26 weeks including seven study visits at the outpatient clinic combined with a weekly telephone consultation in both groups. A follow-up visit 3 months after study completion finalises the intervention. The primary outcome is the difference in the change in 24-hour urine phosphorus excretion from baseline to week 26 between the two study groups. Secondary outcomes include changes in phosphate-related and lipid metabolism-related blood and urine biochemistry, blood pressure and body composition. Moreover, we wish to explore adherence to the diet as well as quality of life. Ethics and dissemination: The study has been approved by the Scientific Ethical Committee of the Capital Region of Denmark and the Danish Data Protection Agency. The results of the studies will be presented at national and international scientific meetings, and publications will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals. Trial registration number: ClinicalTrials.gov (wwwclinicaltrialsgov) Registry (NCT04579315). Protocol version: The protocol, version 2, has been approved by the Ethical Committee Denmark on 18 September 2020. The protocol has also been approved by Data Protection Regulation and Data Protection Law on 15 September 2020. This study protocol is in accordance with the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for International Trials.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Background: To investigate the association of low carbohydrate diet (LCD) score with the risk of type 2 diabetes among adults. Methods: This cohort study was conducted on 4356 healthy participants aged ≥ 19 years old, who were followed-up for a mean duration of 3 years within the framework of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study. LCD score was calculated using a food frequency questionnaire according to intake of carbohydrate, protein, and fat at baseline. Diabetes was defined according to the criteria of the American Diabetes Association. Multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for potential confounders, were used to estimate risk of diabetes across quartiles of LCD score. Results: Mean ± SD age of the study participants (44.4% men) was 40.5 ± 13.0 years. The median (25–75 interquartile range) of LCD score was 17.0 (12.0–21.0) and after a 3 year follow-up period, 123 (2.8%) incident cases of diabetes were ascertained. After adjustment for confounding variables, including age, sex, smoking status, physical activity, total calorie intake, saturated fatty acid, waist circumference, educational level, and family history of diabetes, the multivariable-adjusted ORs (95% CIs) of type 2 diabetes, comparing the highest with the lowest quartiles, were 2.16 (1.16–4.04) for total LCD score (P-value = 0.015), 1.81 (1.06–3.11) for animal-based LCD score (P-value = 0.029), and 1.47 (0.85–2.52) for plant-based LCD score (P-value = 0.160). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that a higher adherence to LCD, mostly with higher intakes of protein and fat from animal-source foods, can increase the incidence of diabetes; however, a plant-based low-carbohydrate dietary pattern is not significantly associated with risk of type 2 diabetes.</td>\n",

The observation period is 26 weeks including seven study visits at the outpatient clinic combined with a weekly telephone consultation in both groups. A follow-up visit 3 months after study completion finalises the intervention. The primary outcome is the difference in the change in 24-hour urine phosphorus excretion from baseline to week 26 between the two study groups. Secondary outcomes include changes in phosphate-related and lipid metabolism-related blood and urine biochemistry, blood pressure and body composition. Moreover, we wish to explore adherence to the diet as well as quality of life.

Methods: This cohort study was conducted on 4356 healthy participants aged ≥ 19 years old, who were followed-up for a mean duration of 3 years within the framework of the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study. LCD score was calculated using a food frequency questionnaire according to intake of carbohydrate, protein, and fat at baseline. Diabetes was defined according to the criteria of the American Diabetes Association. Multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for potential confounders, were used to estimate risk of diabetes across quartiles of LCD score. Results: Mean ± SD age of the study participants (44.4% men) was 40.5 ± 13.0 years. The median (25–75 interquartile range) of LCD score was 17.0 (12.0–21.0) and after a 3 year follow-up period, 123 (2.8%) incident cases of diabetes were ascertained. After adjustment for confounding variables, including age, sex, smoking status, physical activity, total calorie intake, saturated fatty acid, waist circumference, educational level, and family history of diabetes, the multivariable-adjusted ORs (95% CIs) of type 2 diabetes, comparing the highest with the lowest quartiles, were 2.16 (1.16–4.04) for total LCD score (P-value = 0.015), 1.81 (1.06–3.11) for animal-based LCD score (P-value = 0.029), and 1.47 (0.85–2.52) for plant-based LCD score (P-value = 0.160). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that a higher adherence to LCD, mostly with higher intakes of protein and fat from animal-source foods, can increase the incidence of diabetes; however, a plant-based low-carbohydrate dietary pattern is not significantly associated with risk of type 2 diabetes.   \n",
